## 7.14 Final Report Requirements

Prompt Package should require Codex to report:

```text id="5af40m"
- changed files;
- commands run;
- validation result;
- generated files updated;
- acceptance criteria status;
- unresolved risks;
- owner action required.
```

For executable pipeline prompts, the human-readable report is not enough. The generated prompt must also require a final machine-readable execution summary block using this exact contract:

````text
CODEX_EXECUTION_SUMMARY_JSON:
```json
{
  "implementation_summary": "Summarize the completed implementation.",
  "notes": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "blockers": []
}
```
````

Rules:

```text
- the marker must appear on its own line;
- it must be followed by one fenced `json` block;
- the JSON value must be an object;
- the object must contain exactly `implementation_summary`, `notes`, `warnings` and `blockers`;
- no prose, bullets or other text may appear after the closing fence;
- Codex must not emit a full TaskReport payload in this block.
```

The local pipeline adapter parses this block from Codex stdout. It uses the four Codex-authored fields as summary input and derives task identity, changed files, generated files, checks, owner decision status and token usage from trusted pipeline and task evidence.
```

## Context Pack Boundary

When Codex needs additional documentation context, use `contextctl.py` to generate a bounded Context Pack:

```bash
python scripts/contextctl.py pack build --task <TASK_ID> --write
```

Context Pack output is derived retrieval context. It may help Codex decide which source sections to inspect, but it must not change the Prompt Package contract.

Context Pack must not:

```text
- expand Task scope;
- add allowed files;
- add acceptance criteria;
- override out-of-scope items;
- replace source documents or Task state;
- include full tasks.json, full docs.json or full audit logs by default.
```

The default retrieval policy excludes generated files, inactive documents, archived documents, deprecated documents, templates and examples unless explicitly allowed by a `contextctl.py` include flag.

Before `codexctl.py` includes a Context Pack in `CODEX_PROMPT.md`, it must validate that the pack:

```text
- exists;
- has the generated-file header;
- has valid Context Pack metadata;
- matches the requested Task when the pack is task-scoped;
- was generated from the current docs/task revisions recorded in project-control state.
```

If validation fails, `codexctl.py` must fail clearly and must not include stale or invalid retrieved context in the prompt package.

# 17. Relationship To taskctl.py And codexctl.py

Task prompt output can be built by `taskctl.py`.

`taskctl.py` owns:

```text id="d2esmn"
Task state
Current Task
Task generated Markdown
Codex Prompt Package
Task audit events
```

`codexctl.py` owns:

```text
Current Codex execution state
CODEX_STATUS.md
Codex prompt build and clear audit events
Optional read-only Context Pack inclusion in CODEX_PROMPT.md
```

Prompt Package build must not bypass task validation.

Before building the package, task state must be valid.

`contextctl.py` may read Task state to derive a search query for a Context Pack, but it does not mutate Task state and does not make retrieved context executable scope.

`codexctl.py` may validate and include an existing Context Pack, but it must not build the index or refresh Context Pack content itself.

# 3. Current Implementation

Current CLI:

```bash id="55p5jr"
python scripts/taskctl.py prompt build
```

Supported options:

```text id="xuo71y"
--task <TASK_ID>       Build prompt for a specific Task.
--write                Write prompt to AI_PROJECT/generated/CODEX_PROMPT.md.
--out <PATH>           Write prompt to custom output path.
--allow-inactive       Allow prompt build for non-executable statuses.
--skip-plan-check      Validate tasks without checking plan references.
```

Default behavior:

```text id="d56ig6"
If --task is not provided, taskctl.py uses current_task_id.
If no current task exists, prompt build fails.
If task status is not executable and --allow-inactive is not provided, prompt build fails.
```

Dedicated Codex execution CLI:

```bash
python scripts/codexctl.py build --task <TASK_ID>
python scripts/codexctl.py build --task <TASK_ID> --with-context
python scripts/codexctl.py build --task <TASK_ID> --context-pack AI_PROJECT/generated/CONTEXT_PACK.md
python scripts/codexctl.py status
python scripts/codexctl.py clear
```

`--with-context` uses the default generated Context Pack path. `--context-pack` allows an explicit repository-relative or absolute Context Pack path. Both options are read-only with respect to context generation; `contextctl.py` remains responsible for building and refreshing Context Packs.
