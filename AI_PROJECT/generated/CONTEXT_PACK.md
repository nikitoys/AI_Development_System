## Context Control State

Context control uses the state/events/generated model without adding a new source-of-truth state file:

```text
AI_PROJECT/state/docs.json
AI_PROJECT/state/tasks.json
AI_PROJECT/events/context-events.jsonl
AI_PROJECT/generated/CONTEXT_PACK.md
AI_PROJECT/generated/CONTEXT_STATUS.md
```

`scripts/contextctl.py` builds a deterministic derived index in memory from registered documents in `docs.json` and optional Task context from `tasks.json`.

The derived index and Context Pack are not source of truth. They must not expand Task scope, allowed files, out-of-scope items or acceptance criteria. If retrieved context conflicts with the Task or source documents, the Task and source documents remain authoritative.

By default, context control indexes registered active source documents only. It excludes generated files, inactive documents, archived documents, deprecated documents, templates and examples unless the operator explicitly enables the relevant include flag.

`CONTEXT_PACK.md` includes selected source paths, headings, line ranges, source content hashes, chunk hashes, deterministic keyword scores and selection reasons. `CONTEXT_STATUS.md` summarizes the current generated pack, selected paths and exclusion reasons. Both files are generated output and must be regenerated through `contextctl.py`.

## Self-Hosted Command Boundary

AI_Development_System now uses root `/AI_PROJECT` as its own self-hosted Project Control Layer. All protected state, event and generated files in that directory must be changed only through approved CLI gateways.

Current domain commands include:

```bash
python scripts/aictl.py ...
python scripts/planctl.py ...
python scripts/taskctl.py ...
python scripts/codexctl.py ...
python scripts/docctl.py ...
python scripts/evolutionctl.py ...
python scripts/contextctl.py ...
```

Current documentation-control commands include:

```bash
python scripts/docctl.py init
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope ai-system
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope root
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope skills
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope all
python scripts/docctl.py doc register --path <path> --title <title> --type <type> --status <status>
python scripts/docctl.py doc status <path> --to <status>
python scripts/docctl.py doc mark-reviewed <path> --note <text>
python scripts/docctl.py validate
python scripts/docctl.py render
python scripts/docctl.py check-generated
python scripts/docctl.py audit --last 20
```

`docctl.py` owns `AI_PROJECT/state/docs.json`, `AI_PROJECT/events/doc-events.jsonl`, `AI_PROJECT/generated/DOCS_INDEX.md` and `AI_PROJECT/generated/DOCS_GAPS.md`.

## Scope

This document records the command boundary for Project Control Gateway.

The first implemented command surface was plan control:

```bash
python scripts/planctl.py <command>
```

The current owner-facing facade is:

```bash
python scripts/aictl.py <domain> <command>
```

Current implemented control domains include:

```text
plan        Project, Idea, Goal, Strategy, Initiative, Epic
task        Task, Current Task, generated task views
codex       current Codex prompt/status package
context     deterministic Context Pack generated output
docs        documentation registry and generated doc indexes
evolution   Evolution Change Proposals
web         local loopback Web Control Center
pipeline    supervised batch pipeline sessions, gates and generated pipeline status
```

`aictl.py` is a facade and command registry. Domain ownership still belongs to the owning scripts and packages such as `planctl.py`, `taskctl.py`, `docctl.py`, `evolutionctl.py`, `contextctl.py`, `codexctl.py` and `ai_project_ctl/pipeline/**`.

Still-future or partial domains include:

```text
Execution Session
Review
QA Result
Decision
Release
Unified projectctl.py
```

These must not be invented through free-form AI actions. Add them only through approved system evolution and bounded Tasks.
```

## Context Pack Boundary

When Codex needs additional documentation context, use `contextctl.py` to generate a bounded Context Pack:

```bash
python scripts/contextctl.py pack build --task <TASK_ID> --write
```

Context Pack output is derived retrieval context. It may help Codex decide which source sections to inspect, but it must not change the Prompt Package contract.

Context Pack must not:

```text
- expand Task scope;
- add allowed files;
- add acceptance criteria;
- override out-of-scope items;
- replace source documents or Task state;
- include full tasks.json, full docs.json or full audit logs by default.
```

The default retrieval policy excludes generated files, inactive documents, archived documents, deprecated documents, templates and examples unless explicitly allowed by a `contextctl.py` include flag.

Before `codexctl.py` includes a Context Pack in `CODEX_PROMPT.md`, it must validate that the pack:

```text
- exists;
- has the generated-file header;
- has valid Context Pack metadata;
- matches the requested Task when the pack is task-scoped;
- was generated from the current docs/task revisions recorded in project-control state.
```

If validation fails, `codexctl.py` must fail clearly and must not include stale or invalid retrieved context in the prompt package.

# 17. Relationship To taskctl.py And codexctl.py

Task prompt output can be built by `taskctl.py`.

`taskctl.py` owns:

```text id="d2esmn"
Task state
Current Task
Task generated Markdown
Codex Prompt Package
Task audit events
```

`codexctl.py` owns:

```text
Current Codex execution state
CODEX_STATUS.md
Codex prompt build and clear audit events
Optional read-only Context Pack inclusion in CODEX_PROMPT.md
```

Prompt Package build must not bypass task validation.

Before building the package, task state must be valid.

`contextctl.py` may read Task state to derive a search query for a Context Pack, but it does not mutate Task state and does not make retrieved context executable scope.

`codexctl.py` may validate and include an existing Context Pack, but it must not build the index or refresh Context Pack content itself.

| Skill | Purpose | Related CLI | Priority | Allowed Actions | Forbidden Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project Control Gateway Skill | Route plan, task, documentation and evolution work through the controlled CLI gateway instead of manual state edits. | `planctl.py`, `taskctl.py`, `docctl.py`, `evolutionctl.py` | P0 | Inspect state through CLI, choose allowed commands, run validation and render commands, report unsupported operations. | Manually edit `AI_PROJECT/state/**`, `AI_PROJECT/events/**` or `AI_PROJECT/generated/**`; invent lifecycle states or commands; execute Initiative or Epic directly. |
| Clarification Gate Skill | Teach Codex and subagents when to inspect first, proceed with safe assumptions, or stop for Human Owner blocker questions. | `planctl.py`, `taskctl.py`, `docctl.py`, `evolutionctl.py` | P0 | Classify blockers, group owner questions, identify safe defaults, preserve task and approval boundaries. | Use questions to avoid normal inspection; ask for approval after every small step; self-approve accepted, approved, active or done states. |
| Documentation Navigation Skill | Route Codex and subagents to the minimal correct documentation and project-control read set before planning, editing, reviewing or executing AI_Development_System work.
