## Context Pack Boundary

When Codex needs additional documentation context, use `contextctl.py` to generate a bounded Context Pack:

```bash
python scripts/contextctl.py pack build --task <TASK_ID> --write
```

Context Pack output is derived retrieval context. It may help Codex decide which source sections to inspect, but it must not change the Prompt Package contract.

Context Pack must not:

```text
- expand Task scope;
- add allowed files;
- add acceptance criteria;
- override out-of-scope items;
- replace source documents or Task state;
- include full tasks.json, full docs.json or full audit logs by default.
```

The default retrieval policy excludes generated files, inactive documents, archived documents, deprecated documents, templates and examples unless explicitly allowed by a `contextctl.py` include flag.

Before `codexctl.py` includes a Context Pack in `CODEX_PROMPT.md`, it must validate that the pack:

```text
- exists;
- has the generated-file header;
- has valid Context Pack metadata;
- matches the requested Task when the pack is task-scoped;
- was generated from the current docs/task revisions recorded in project-control state.
```

If validation fails, `codexctl.py` must fail clearly and must not include stale or invalid retrieved context in the prompt package.

# 17. Relationship To taskctl.py And codexctl.py

Task prompt output can be built by `taskctl.py`.

`taskctl.py` owns:

```text id="d2esmn"
Task state
Current Task
Task generated Markdown
Codex Prompt Package
Task audit events
```

`codexctl.py` owns:

```text
Current Codex execution state
CODEX_STATUS.md
Codex prompt build and clear audit events
Optional read-only Context Pack inclusion in CODEX_PROMPT.md
```

Prompt Package build must not bypass task validation.

Before building the package, task state must be valid.

`contextctl.py` may read Task state to derive a search query for a Context Pack, but it does not mutate Task state and does not make retrieved context executable scope.

`codexctl.py` may validate and include an existing Context Pack, but it must not build the index or refresh Context Pack content itself.

# 3. Current Implementation

Current CLI:

```bash id="55p5jr"
python scripts/taskctl.py prompt build
```

Supported options:

```text id="xuo71y"
--task <TASK_ID>       Build prompt for a specific Task.
--write                Write prompt to AI_PROJECT/generated/CODEX_PROMPT.md.
--out <PATH>           Write prompt to custom output path.
--allow-inactive       Allow prompt build for non-executable statuses.
--skip-plan-check      Validate tasks without checking plan references.
```

Default behavior:

```text id="d56ig6"
If --task is not provided, taskctl.py uses current_task_id.
If no current task exists, prompt build fails.
If task status is not executable and --allow-inactive is not provided, prompt build fails.
```

Dedicated Codex execution CLI:

```bash
python scripts/codexctl.py build --task <TASK_ID>
python scripts/codexctl.py build --task <TASK_ID> --with-context
python scripts/codexctl.py build --task <TASK_ID> --context-pack AI_PROJECT/generated/CONTEXT_PACK.md
python scripts/codexctl.py status
python scripts/codexctl.py clear
```

`--with-context` uses the default generated Context Pack path. `--context-pack` allows an explicit repository-relative or absolute Context Pack path. Both options are read-only with respect to context generation; `contextctl.py` remains responsible for building and refreshing Context Packs.

## Scope

This document records the command boundary for Project Control Gateway.

The first implemented command surface was plan control:

```bash
python scripts/planctl.py <command>
```

The current owner-facing facade is:

```bash
python scripts/aictl.py <domain> <command>
```

Current implemented control domains include:

```text
plan        Project, Idea, Goal, Strategy, Initiative, Epic
task        Task, Current Task, generated task views
codex       current Codex prompt/status package
context     deterministic Context Pack generated output
docs        documentation registry and generated doc indexes
evolution   Evolution Change Proposals
web         local loopback Web Control Center
```

`aictl.py` is a facade and command registry. Domain ownership still belongs to the owning scripts such as `planctl.py`, `taskctl.py`, `docctl.py`, `evolutionctl.py`, `contextctl.py` and `codexctl.py`.

Still-future or partial domains include:

```text
Execution Session
Review
QA Result
Decision
Release
Unified projectctl.py
```

These must not be invented through free-form AI actions. Add them only through approved system evolution and bounded Tasks.
```
