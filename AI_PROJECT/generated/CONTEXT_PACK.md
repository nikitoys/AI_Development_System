## 7.14 Final Report Requirements

Prompt Package should require Codex to report:

```text id="5af40m"
- changed files;
- commands run;
- validation result;
- generated files updated;
- acceptance criteria status;
- unresolved risks;
- owner action required.
```

For executable pipeline prompts, the human-readable report is not enough. The generated prompt must also require a final machine-readable execution summary block using this exact contract:

````text
CODEX_EXECUTION_SUMMARY_JSON:
```json
{
  "implementation_summary": "Summarize the completed implementation.",
  "notes": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "blockers": []
}
```
````

Rules:

```text
- the marker must appear on its own line;
- it must be followed by one fenced `json` block;
- the JSON value must be an object;
- the object must contain exactly `implementation_summary`, `notes`, `warnings` and `blockers`;
- no prose, bullets or other text may appear after the closing fence;
- Codex must not emit a full TaskReport payload in this block.
```

The local pipeline adapter parses this block from Codex stdout. It uses the four Codex-authored fields as summary input and derives task identity, changed files, generated files, checks, owner decision status and token usage from trusted pipeline and task evidence.
```

## Context Pack Boundary

When Codex needs additional documentation context, use `contextctl.py` to generate a bounded Context Pack:

```bash
python scripts/contextctl.py pack build --task <TASK_ID> --write
```

Context Pack output is derived retrieval context. It may help Codex decide which source sections to inspect, but it must not change the Prompt Package contract.

Context Pack must not:

```text
- expand Task scope;
- add allowed files;
- add acceptance criteria;
- override out-of-scope items;
- replace source documents or Task state;
- include full tasks.json, full docs.json or full audit logs by default.
```

The default retrieval policy excludes generated files, inactive documents, archived documents, deprecated documents, templates and examples unless explicitly allowed by a `contextctl.py` include flag.

Before `codexctl.py` includes a Context Pack in `CODEX_PROMPT.md`, it must validate that the pack:

```text
- exists;
- has the generated-file header;
- has valid Context Pack metadata;
- matches the requested Task when the pack is task-scoped;
- was generated from the current docs/task revisions recorded in project-control state.
```

If validation fails, `codexctl.py` must fail clearly and must not include stale or invalid retrieved context in the prompt package.

# 17. Relationship To taskctl.py And codexctl.py

Task prompt output can be built by `taskctl.py`.

`taskctl.py` owns:

```text id="d2esmn"
Task state
Current Task
Task generated Markdown
Codex Prompt Package
Task audit events
```

`codexctl.py` owns:

```text
Current Codex execution state
CODEX_STATUS.md
Codex prompt build and clear audit events
Optional read-only Context Pack inclusion in CODEX_PROMPT.md
```

Prompt Package build must not bypass task validation.

Before building the package, task state must be valid.

`contextctl.py` may read Task state to derive a search query for a Context Pack, but it does not mutate Task state and does not make retrieved context executable scope.

`codexctl.py` may validate and include an existing Context Pack, but it must not build the index or refresh Context Pack content itself.

## Context Control State

Context control uses the state/events/generated model without adding a new source-of-truth state file:

```text
AI_PROJECT/state/docs.json
AI_PROJECT/state/tasks.json
AI_PROJECT/events/context-events.jsonl
AI_PROJECT/generated/CONTEXT_PACK.md
AI_PROJECT/generated/CONTEXT_STATUS.md
```

`scripts/contextctl.py` builds a deterministic derived index in memory from registered documents in `docs.json` and optional Task context from `tasks.json`.

The derived index and Context Pack are not source of truth. They must not expand Task scope, allowed files, out-of-scope items or acceptance criteria. If retrieved context conflicts with the Task or source documents, the Task and source documents remain authoritative.

By default, context control indexes registered active source documents only. It excludes generated files, inactive documents, archived documents, deprecated documents, templates and examples unless the operator explicitly enables the relevant include flag.

`CONTEXT_PACK.md` includes selected source paths, headings, line ranges, source content hashes, chunk hashes, deterministic keyword scores and selection reasons. `CONTEXT_STATUS.md` summarizes the current generated pack, selected paths and exclusion reasons. Both files are generated output and must be regenerated through `contextctl.py`.
