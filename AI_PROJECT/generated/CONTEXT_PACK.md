## Self-Hosted Command Boundary

AI_Development_System now uses root `/AI_PROJECT` as its own self-hosted Project Control Layer. All protected state, event and generated files in that directory must be changed only through approved CLI gateways.

Current domain commands include:

```bash
python scripts/aictl.py ...
python scripts/planctl.py ...
python scripts/taskctl.py ...
python scripts/codexctl.py ...
python scripts/docctl.py ...
python scripts/evolutionctl.py ...
python scripts/contextctl.py ...
```

Current documentation-control commands include:

```bash
python scripts/docctl.py init
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope ai-system
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope root
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope skills
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope all

python scripts/docctl.py validate
python scripts/docctl.py render
python scripts/docctl.py check-generated
python scripts/docctl.py audit --last 20
```

`docctl.py` owns `AI_PROJECT/state/docs.json`, `AI_PROJECT/events/doc-events.jsonl`, `AI_PROJECT/generated/DOCS_INDEX.md` and `AI_PROJECT/generated/DOCS_GAPS.md`.

pipeline session step-result
pipeline session stop

pipeline run-next
pipeline run-until-blocker
```

Current implementation entry point:

```bash
python scripts/aictl.py pipeline ...
```

Pipeline commands manage supervised pipeline sessions, selected queues, policy snapshots, gate outcomes, stop reasons, generated pipeline status and generated pipeline audit output. They must route through `aictl.py` and the `ai_project_ctl/pipeline/**` services. They must not manually edit `AI_PROJECT/state/pipeline_sessions.json`, `AI_PROJECT/events/pipeline-events.jsonl`, `AI_PROJECT/generated/PIPELINE_STATUS.md` or `AI_PROJECT/generated/PIPELINE_AUDIT.md`.

`pipeline run-next` advances at most one guarded step. `pipeline run-until-blocker` composes `run-next`, requires `--confirm`, stops on the first blocker or queue completion and does not introduce background execution.

Pipeline policies must not authorize push, merge, automatic Evolution Change approval, automatic Evolution Change acceptance, or Human Owner final acceptance. Local commits, when policy-enabled, are local-only and require passing report, machine review, Codex review and commit-readiness gates.

## Controller Codex Responsibilities

Controller Codex is responsible for:

- reading project-control state and source documents;
- selecting the minimal source context;
- checking that the parent Task or Agent Work Package is bounded;
- preparing the Worker Agent Prompt Package;
- stating scope, out of scope, allowed files and forbidden actions;
- requiring structured result output;
- receiving the Worker Agent Result;
- performing Agent Result Intake;
- routing Integration Review, review or QA when needed;
- updating lifecycle state only through CLI gateways;
- preserving Human Owner approval boundaries.

Controller Codex must not:

- launch Worker Agent sessions automatically;
- approve Worker Agent output automatically;
- accept final task results for the Human Owner;
- edit protected `AI_PROJECT` files manually;
- imply that L4 or runtime behavior is approved;
- widen Worker Agent scope after the handoff without owner-controlled task updates.

```text
## Context Pack Boundary

When Codex needs additional documentation context, use `contextctl.py` to generate a bounded Context Pack:

```bash
python scripts/contextctl.py pack build --task <TASK_ID> --write
```

Context Pack output is derived retrieval context. It may help Codex decide which source sections to inspect, but it must not change the Prompt Package contract.

Context Pack must not:

```text
- expand Task scope;
- add allowed files;
- add acceptance criteria;
- override out-of-scope items;
- replace source documents or Task state;
- include full tasks.json, full docs.json or full audit logs by default.
```

The default retrieval policy excludes generated files, inactive documents, archived documents, deprecated documents, templates and examples unless explicitly allowed by a `contextctl.py` include flag.

Before `codexctl.py` includes a Context Pack in `CODEX_PROMPT.md`, it must validate that the pack:

```text
- exists;
- has the generated-file header;
- has valid Context Pack metadata;
- matches the requested Task when the pack is task-scoped;
- was generated from the current docs/task revisions recorded in project-control state.
```

If validation fails, `codexctl.py` must fail clearly and must not include stale or invalid retrieved context in the prompt package.

## Documentation Control State

Documentation control uses the same state/events/generated model:

```text
AI_PROJECT/state/docs.json
AI_PROJECT/events/doc-events.jsonl
AI_PROJECT/generated/DOCS_INDEX.md
AI_PROJECT/generated/DOCS_GAPS.md
```

`docs.json` is the authoritative registry for managed documentation. Each registered document stores lifecycle metadata plus derived retrieval metadata:

```text
path
title
type
status
required
owner
content_hash
last_reviewed_at
last_reviewed_by
last_reviewed_content_hash
declared_status
declared_status_raw
declared_status_source
```

`content_hash` is the current SHA-256 hash recorded by `docctl.py`. `last_reviewed_content_hash` is the SHA-256 hash reviewed by `docctl.py doc mark-reviewed`. Declared status fields are derived from document frontmatter, `Status:` metadata lines or a `## Status` section when present.

`DOCS_GAPS.md` is generated from `docs.json` and current source files. It groups actionable gaps such as missing files, status mismatch, stale reviews, unresolved placeholders, broken local links and stale content hash metadata.
```
