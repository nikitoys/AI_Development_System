Task Status: in_review
Title: UIX-01 Improve Tasks filtering grouping and collapse

Make the Tasks page usable for large projects by adding initiative/epic/status filters, search, grouping, and collapsible done sections.

Improve the Web Control Center Tasks page so the owner can focus on one initiative, one epic, or active tasks only instead of scrolling through the full task history.

Scope:
- Add filtering by Initiative.
- Add filtering by Epic.
- Add filtering by Status.
- Add search by task ref, legacy id, title, and summary.
- Add grouping by Epic and Status.
- Add collapsible groups.
- Hide done tasks by default or collapse done groups by default.
- Show readable task refs such as WFA-04 alongside legacy TASK-XXX ids.
- Preserve read-only/dashboard performance improvements.

Out of Scope:
- Do not add new write actions in this task.
- Do not change task lifecycle rules.
- Do not change task identity/ref allocation.
- Do not directly edit AI_PROJECT/state/**, AI_PROJECT/events/**, or AI_PROJECT/generated/**.

Allowed Files:
- ai_project_ctl/web/read_model.py
- ai_project_ctl/web/server.py
- ai_project_ctl/web/actions.py if filter state needs action metadata
- tests/test_web_control_center.py
- tests/test_aictl.py if aictl web routing is touched

Implementation Instructions:
- Inspect current files before editing.
- Stay within allowed files.
- Preserve existing conventions.
- Prefer minimal, commit-ready changes.
- Do not perform unrelated refactors.
- Do not edit AI_PROJECT/state/**, AI_PROJECT/events/** or AI_PROJECT/generated/** manually.

## Self-Hosted Command Boundary

AI_Development_System now uses root `/AI_PROJECT` as its own self-hosted Project Control Layer. All protected state, event and generated files in that directory must be changed only through approved CLI gateways.

Current domain commands include:

```bash
python scripts/aictl.py ...
python scripts/planctl.py ...
python scripts/taskctl.py ...
python scripts/codexctl.py ...
python scripts/docctl.py ...
python scripts/evolutionctl.py ...
python scripts/contextctl.py ...
```

Current documentation-control commands include:

```bash
python scripts/docctl.py init
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope ai-system
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope root
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope skills
python scripts/docctl.py scan --scope all
python scripts/docctl.py doc register --path <path> --title <title> --type <type> --status <status>
python scripts/docctl.py doc status <path> --to <status>
python scripts/docctl.py doc mark-reviewed <path> --note <text>
python scripts/docctl.py validate
python scripts/docctl.py render
python scripts/docctl.py check-generated
python scripts/docctl.py audit --last 20
```

`docctl.py` owns `AI_PROJECT/state/docs.json`, `AI_PROJECT/events/doc-events.jsonl`, `AI_PROJECT/generated/DOCS_INDEX.md` and `AI_PROJECT/generated/DOCS_GAPS.md`.

## Context Control State

Context control uses the state/events/generated model without adding a new source-of-truth state file:

```text
AI_PROJECT/state/docs.json
AI_PROJECT/state/tasks.json
AI_PROJECT/events/context-events.jsonl
AI_PROJECT/generated/CONTEXT_PACK.md
AI_PROJECT/generated/CONTEXT_STATUS.md
```

`scripts/contextctl.py` builds a deterministic derived index in memory from registered documents in `docs.json` and optional Task context from `tasks.json`.

The derived index and Context Pack are not source of truth. They must not expand Task scope, allowed files, out-of-scope items or acceptance criteria. If retrieved context conflicts with the Task or source documents, the Task and source documents remain authoritative.

By default, context control indexes registered active source documents only. It excludes generated files, inactive documents, archived documents, deprecated documents, templates and examples unless the operator explicitly enables the relevant include flag.

`CONTEXT_PACK.md` includes selected source paths, headings, line ranges, source content hashes, chunk hashes, deterministic keyword scores and selection reasons. `CONTEXT_STATUS.md` summarizes the current generated pack, selected paths and exclusion reasons. Both files are generated output and must be regenerated through `contextctl.py`.

## Context Pack Boundary

When Codex needs additional documentation context, use `contextctl.py` to generate a bounded Context Pack:

```bash
python scripts/contextctl.py pack build --task <TASK_ID> --write
```

Context Pack output is derived retrieval context. It may help Codex decide which source sections to inspect, but it must not change the Prompt Package contract.

Context Pack must not:

```text
- expand Task scope;
- add allowed files;
- add acceptance criteria;
- override out-of-scope items;
- replace source documents or Task state;
- include full tasks.json, full docs.json or full audit logs by default.
```

The default retrieval policy excludes generated files, inactive documents, archived documents, deprecated documents, templates and examples unless explicitly allowed by a `contextctl.py` include flag.

Before `codexctl.py` includes a Context Pack in `CODEX_PROMPT.md`, it must validate that the pack:

```text
- exists;
- has the generated-file header;
- has valid Context Pack metadata;
- matches the requested Task when the pack is task-scoped;
- was generated from the current docs/task revisions recorded in project-control state.
```

If validation fails, `codexctl.py` must fail clearly and must not include stale or invalid retrieved context in the prompt package.

# 17. Relationship To taskctl.py And codexctl.py

Task prompt output can be built by `taskctl.py`.

`taskctl.py` owns:

```text id="d2esmn"
Task state
Current Task
Task generated Markdown
Codex Prompt Package
Task audit events
```

`codexctl.py` owns:

```text
Current Codex execution state
CODEX_STATUS.md
Codex prompt build and clear audit events
Optional read-only Context Pack inclusion in CODEX_PROMPT.md
```

Prompt Package build must not bypass task validation.

Before building the package, task state must be valid.

`contextctl.py` may read Task state to derive a search query for a Context Pack, but it does not mutate Task state and does not make retrieved context executable scope.

`codexctl.py` may validate and include an existing Context Pack, but it must not build the index or refresh Context Pack content itself.

# 3. Current Implementation

Current CLI:

```bash id="55p5jr"
python scripts/taskctl.py prompt build
```

Supported options:

```text id="xuo71y"
--task <TASK_ID>       Build prompt for a specific Task.
--write                Write prompt to AI_PROJECT/generated/CODEX_PROMPT.md.
--out <PATH>           Write prompt to custom output path.
--allow-inactive       Allow prompt build for non-executable statuses.
--skip-plan-check      Validate tasks without checking plan references.
```

Default behavior:

```text id="d56ig6"
If --task is not provided, taskctl.py uses current_task_id.
If no current task exists, prompt build fails.
If task status is not executable and --allow-inactive is not provided, prompt build fails.
```

Dedicated Codex execution CLI:

```bash
python scripts/codexctl.py build --task <TASK_ID>
python scripts/codexctl.py build --task <TASK_ID> --with-context
python scripts/codexctl.py build --task <TASK_ID> --context-pack AI_PROJECT/generated/CONTEXT_PACK.md
python scripts/codexctl.py status
python scripts/codexctl.py clear
```

`--with-context` uses the default generated Context Pack path. `--context-pack` allows an explicit repository-relative or absolute Context Pack path. Both options are read-only with respect to context generation; `contextctl.py` remains responsible for building and refreshing Context Packs.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Tasks page can be filtered by initiative, epic, status, and search text.
- Tasks page can group tasks by epic or status.
- Done tasks are hidden or collapsed by default.
- Current task, in-progress tasks, and review tasks remain easy to find.
- GET / and GET /data.json remain fast and do not run full doctor on every request.
- No new write behavior is introduced.
- Tests and project-control validations pass.

Verification:
- Use verification mode `standard`.
- Run the validation commands required by the task and report results.

Result Format:
- Summary
- Changed files
- Commands run
- Verification result
- Blockers or risks

Review / Result Format Notes:
- Verify that filtering and grouping work with EPIC-005/CTL and EPIC-006/WFA.
- Verify that done tasks no longer dominate the default task view.
- Verify that Web write safety is unchanged.
